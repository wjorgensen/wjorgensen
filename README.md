# About Me
My name is Adam "Wes" Weston Jorgensen. I'm currently studying Economics and Computer Science at Boston University. I'm very interested in Finance, Computers, and the combination of the two. This has natrually led me to learn about blockchain and all of its applications.  I've become ver proficient in Solidity and Javascript as I've developed blockchain projects. I currently use Foundry to do so. I hope to become an entrepreneur in the blockchain space but am currently looking for internehsips in the blockchain space for summer 2024. Please reach out to [wjorg@bu.edu](mailto:wjorg@bu.edu?subject=Hello) if you a recruiter.
