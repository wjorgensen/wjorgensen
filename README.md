# About Me
My name is Adam "Wes" Weston Jorgensen. I'm currently studying Economics and Computer Science at Boston University. I'm very interested in Finance, Computers, and the combination of the two. This has natrually led me to learn about blockchain and all of its applications.  I've become very proficient in Solidity and Javascript as I've developed blockchain projects. I currently use Foundry to do so. I hope to become an entrepreneur in the blockchain space. I like building cool stuff with smart people if either of those fit please reach out to [wjorg@bu.edu](mailto:wjorg@bu.edu?subject=Hello).
